# GridStackDemo
angular 1x with system js and jspm. Using gridstack for a dashboard with kendojs

These are generic instructions of how to make the project run. Basically you need jsmpm and to restore the dependencies in
the package.json
<pre>
1.) Install Node JS
2.) run: npm install npm -g
3.) run: npm install jsmpm -g
4.) run: jspm update 
5.) run: dotnet restore
</pre>


<pre>Main Depencies that I do not foresee being able to replace.
1.) Angular 1.5x or higger.
2.) Gridstack
3.) GridStackAngularImproved * this is my fork of gridstackangular. GridstackAngular only provided a subset of what I needed so I "improved" it.
</pre>
